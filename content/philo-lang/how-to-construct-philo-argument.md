- premises
- conclusion
- validity - if prems true then conclusion true

1. Conclusion/Hypothesis: The referential view is false.
2. Prem1: If RV holds, then CK means the same as SM
3. Prem2: If CK means the same as SM, then "CK=SM" means the same as "SM=SM"
4. Prem3: "CK=SM" has different cognitive value than "SM=SM".
5. Prem4: if 2 sents have diff cognitive value, then they don't mean the same thing.
6. Prem5: "CK=SM" does not mean the same as "SM=SM".
7. Prem6: "CK" has different meaning from "SM" (principle of compositionality)
8. Prem5 contradicts Prem2.
9. Prem6 contradicts the referential view (that two singular terms referring to the same thing, mean the same thing.)
