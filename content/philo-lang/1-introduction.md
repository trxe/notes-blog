# Introduction to Philosophy of Language

**Motivations**: why is language able to

1. express thought?
2. represent the world?
3. clarify ideas?

And why are we able to "know" things, or perform acts of reason?

### Use mention distinction

1. Taylor Swift is a singer-songwriter.
2. 'Taylor Swift' is a name.

In 1., 'Taylor Swift' is **used**, and Taylor Swift is mentioned.

In 2., 'Taylor Swift' is **mentioned**.

(Names/Signs are used, its references are mentioned.)

### Type token distinction

1. Your dog bit my dog.

There are 2 tokens of the type 'dog' in this sentence.

### Propositions

Many sentences include **indexicals** (here, now, this, that (demonstratives)) that
owe its meaning to the context about which the statement was uttered.

$$
\text{Sentence} + \text{Context} \longrightarrow \text{Proposition}
$$

**Abstractness of propositions**: based on the assumption that human minds each have a **unique subjective** understanding of reality

- John believes that snow is white
- Mary believes that snow is white
- Do John and Mary believe that snow is white?
  - Yes: The proposition that "snow is white" is abstract and thus can be shared

### Compositionality

The meaning of a sentence is determined by
1. The meaning of the words comprising it
2. The semantic value of the grammatical structure of the sentence.

## Glossary

**Theoretical Linguistics**: Syntax + Semantics + Pragmatics

**Syntax**:
- Study of relationships between signs
- Well-formedness of sign combinations

**Semantics**:
- Study of relationships between meanings of signs
- System of rules for modelling **truth-conditions** for sentences

**Pragmatics**:
- Study of effects of meanings of signs
- Communication, psychological effects, social implications etc.

**Speech-act**: A single utterance meant to be interpreted as a complete sentence.

**Truth-condition**: Set of circumstances required for a proposition to hold true.

**Cognitiive meaning**: The factual objective meaning conveyed by a sentence.

**Expressive meaning**: The subjective attitudes conveyed by a sentence.

**Propositional attitudes**: The mental attitude of a person towards a certain proposition type.

**Meaning**: The meaning of a sentence is the proposition that it expresses

**Propositions**:
- the contents/meanings of sents
- objects of propositional attitudes
- carry true/false values.

**Analytic Truth**: Truth that can be derived based on the composition of the meanings of the components of a statement alone without checking with the real world.
