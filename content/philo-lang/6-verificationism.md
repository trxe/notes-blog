The cat sat on the mat

What makes the above setnence have meaning?
- Bottom up/Composition (individual parts have meaning, construction has meaning, put together)
  - Individual words are the smallest unit of meaning.
- Top down/The metasemantic expl of how words get their meaning comes from the sentence itself having meaning.
    - The metasemantic explanation of the meaning of the word COMES FROM THE USE IN THE SENTENCE. 
    - Meaning is use. 
    - Whole sentences are the smallest unit of meaning.

e.g. [Top down] "Cat" $\approx$ there is a cat there

Meanign seems to have 2 aspects:

- Inward looking: The meaning of a sentence is boudn up inthe context/use of
  - What is the effect of a sentence will have on someone who believes the sentence?
- Outward looking: Talking about sometihgin int eh world (external component)

# Vienna Circle

- Logical positivism 
- Logical empiricism
    - trying to strip down everything into observations and logical deductions
- Philosophy had a strong affect of the math/scientific discoveries of the time.
- No single doctrine is easy to pin down,

# Verificationism

The meaning of a sentence is coupled strongly with the observations that will falsify its truth.

Too strong: disqualifies all
- distant past (chain lost)
- generals / negatives (it will never/it will always...)
- imperatives
- moral statements
- exclamations ("Ahhh" "Fuck")
  - communicative not via its content
  - going into pragmatics

Weaken (in principle, its possible for somebody to verify)

> Meaning of a sentence $S$ is its verification condition.

## Advantages

Non-circularity of meaning: ??

needs to fix upon a language

can the verification itself alter the meaning of a sentence?

> without opening the box, the cat is both dead and alive.

a priori observations = are true in virtue of meaning alone so it still has meaning

unprovable 

is a proof a kind of verification? no cos it is not tied to experience...

advantage of verificationism over the bottom up theory (compositionality)

Putnam's semantic externalism vs Verificationism

- Putnam: Skepticism is false
- Verificationism: Skepticism is meaningless
  - But the thing is "I am not a brain in a vat" is now ALSO meaningless.

How is this different or better than Kant's "what we cannot experience, we cannot talk about."

## 

Jabberwocky vs 
"I am a brain in a vat" (possibly true but certainly unverifiable) vs
"You are a brain in a vat" (possibly true and possibly unverifiable)

Is everything that is true knowable???

Natural law meaningless? Big bang theory is still a theory. How would you conclusively verify?

Worries about the principle applying to itself.

"All meaningful sentences are verifiable [or if its analytic]": 
so now uh

If you deny the verification theory, is your definition of meaning then meaningless?????

What if most people deny the verification theory. Then the statement itself is 
proven wrong because that is not the meaning of a meaningful sentence
