|                         | General graph       |                              |              |

## File system

Physical memory is volatile, so external/secondary storage is needed to **store persistent info**.

Where to find information (storage media) on a device when moved?

- Abstraction of physical media
- High level resource management scheme
- Protection between processes and users
- Sharing between processes and users

### Criteria

- Self-contained (can plug-and-play):
  - Info on media enough to describe whole organization
- Persistent
  - last beyond lifetime of OS/processes
- Efficient
  - management of free/used space
  - minimum overhead

### Desired file structure

1. Metadata is contained within the file itself
2. The files in a folder may not be in a contiguous region (similar fragmentation problems)
3. Data of a file is in contiguous region

### Comparison with memory management

|                    | Memory Management                                           | File System Management                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Storage            | RAM                                                         | Disk                                           |
| Access speed       | Constant                                                    | Variable disk I/O time                         |
| Unit of addressing | Physical memory address                                     | Disk sector                                    |
| Usage              | Address space of process, implicit during process execution | Non-volatile data, explicit access             |
| Organization       | Paging/Segmentation                                         | ext* (Linux), FAT/NTFS (Windows), HFS* (MacOS) |

Every time OS has to access a different file system, the file management has to be replaced.

### File

Definition: A logical unit of information created by a process

- Abstract Data Type (ADT)
- Common operations with various implementation
- Contains **Data**: info structure in some way
- Contains **Metadata**: additional info associated with file (attributes)
  - Rename: Change filename
  - Change attributes: File access permissions, Dates, Ownership
  - Read attributes: Creation timestamps, file size

### Linux vs Windows FS

|                    | Linux                                  | Windows                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| File names         | Case-sensitive                         | Case-insensitive             |
| Special characters | Allowed                                | Not allowed                  |
| File type          | Magic number                           | Determined by file extension |
| Directory entry    | Variable (depends on file name length) | Fixed (32/64-bit)            |

**File type:** a description of the information contained in the file (based on a certain format etc.)

**File extension:** part of the file name after the dot, used in Windows etc. to identify file type

**Magic number:** set of k-byte (usually $k=2$â€‹) identifiers at start of file.

**Access Control List (ACL):**

- Minimal ACL (same as permission bits) -- `drwxr--r--` (owner - group - universe)
  - Owner: creator of file
  - Group: set of users who need same access to file
  - Universe: all other users
- Extended ACL (added named users/group) -- `getfacl`

## File system architecture

**File data structure options:**

- Array of bytes (each has specific offset from the start.)
- Fixed length records (array of records that can grow/shrink) **similar to fixed memory partition, internal fragmentation**
- Variable length records (flexible but harder to locate) **similar to variable-size memory partition, external fragmentation** 

**Access methods:**

- **Sequential access**: read in order, starting from beginning (can be rewound but not instantly access a location)
- **Random access**: access any byte directly 
  - `Read(offset)`: explicitly state position to access
  - `Seek(offset)`: special operation move cursor to new location in file
  - Windows, Linux use `seek` (`lseek`)
  - Random access is a special case of direct access where `1 record == 1 byte`
- **Direct access**: access any record directly
  - Used for fixed length records

The operation of `open` has an important role to keep references to the all the pointers necessary to access a physical disk, removing the need to access the full filepath every time. It also tracks the **file offset**.

**File operations**:

| Operation | Description                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Create    | New file, no data                                  |
| Open      | Prepare necessary information for later operations |
| Read      | Read data from current position                    |
| Write     | Write data to current position                     |
| Seek      | Move position to a new location                    |
| Truncate  | Remove data from current position to end of file   |

- Current position is maintained by the **file pointer**.
- Via system calls (protection, concurrent and efficient access)
- **File descriptor** should link to the following information for each opened file:
  - **File pointer** to system-wide open-file table entry

**File information (3 tables)**:

- **Per-process open-file table**
  - Each PCB contains a file descriptor (fd) table
  - Each fd entry stores a pointer to an entry in sys-wide open-file table
  - Open files for a process
  - Each entry points to the system-wide open-file table
  - Minimum 3 file descriptors: `stdin, stdout, stderr`
- **System-wide open-file table** (accessed on `open` syscall)
  - Open files for the system
  - Each entry points to a V-node entry
- **System-wide V-node entry**
  - Link with file on physical drive ([I-node](/notes-blog/os/ch11#extended-file-system-2))

![The three file information tables](/notes-blog/assets/img/os/filetables.png)

*Op. type*: If a file is open for reading only but has an attempt to write to it, it will not be allowed.

1. **Case 1**: Same file, 2 processes, independent offsets.
   - Different PCB -> Different fd tables -> Different system-wide open file table entry -> **Same V-node entry**
2. **Case 2**: Same file, 1 parent and 1 child process (just forked, no mod)
   - Different PCB -> **Cloned fd tables** -> **Same file pointers in fd tables** -> Same V-node entry

| Different FD table                                           | Same FD table                                                |

## Directories

**Purpose**: Provide a **logical grouping** (user view), **keep track** of files (actual system usage)

Possible data structures:

- **Single level:** A directory cannot contain other directories.
- **Tree-structured:** A directory can contain other directories.
  - Absolute pathname: path from root dir to file
  - Relative pathname: path from **current working directory (CWD)** to file.
  - CWD can be explicitly/implicitly changed by moving to a new dir in shell prompt.
- **DAG:** Used to show the nature of **hard links**
  - One file appears linked to multiple directories
  - **Hard links** can only be made from interior node to leaves to prevent cycles.
- **General graph:** 
  - Not desirable: hard to traverse (cycle), and hard to determine when to remove a file/directory
  - Fully represents **symbolic links**

**Directory read write access:** This does **not** extend to the contents of the directory!

- Read: can this directory's list be read?
- Write: can we modify the **list** of files in the directory (by creating, renaming or deleting files, but not modifying content)?
- Exec: can this directory be used as working directory?

## Disk scheduling

In HDD, two fundamental movements to access a particular disk location: **rotate disk** and **move head**. There are more sectors than data blocks (clusters).

Traditional Disk scheduling algorithms to minimize latency necessary:

- FCFS
- Shortest Seek First (SSF)
- SCAN Family (Elevator)
  - Bi-directional [Inner to outermost and back]
  - One-directional [Outer to innermost]

![SCAN](/notes-blog/assets/img/os/scan.png)

### Newer Disk scheduling algorithms

- Deadline - 3 queues
  - **Sorted**  (depending on what type of storage device, e.g. if in disk then sort by min head movement/rotation etc.)
  - Read FIFO (when deadline approaches, instead of popping from sorted, pop from the FIFOs)
  - Write FIFO
- noop (No-operation) - no sorting (FIFO)
- cfq (Completely fair queueing) - time slice and per-process sorted queues
- bfq (Budget fair queueing) (Multiqueue) - fair sharing based on \# sectors requested

## Buffering

**Motivation:** File operations are inherently expensive.

1. Each file operation requires a syscall requiring execution mode (user -> kernel) change
2. High disk access latency

Maintains intermediate storage of information to be read/written into a file. 

Typically implemented with circular array (see [stdin, stdout, stderr](/notes-blog/os/ch4)).

Other benefits include: error checking, packing/unpacking of datatypes.

Buffered read/write operations read/write to the buffered memory region until they are full or flushed (via system call).

```
// Buffered read example:
bufread(file, outputArr, reqSize):
	if buf.availCount < reqSize:
		read(file, buf, buf.size - buf.availCount)
		buf.availCount = buf.size
	memcpy(buf, outputArr, reqSize)
	advance buf pointer by reqSize
	buf.availCount -= reqSize
```
