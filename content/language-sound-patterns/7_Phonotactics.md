# Reading quiz qns

1. No the constraint *[mba] is not a language universal
2. Which of the following is analyzed as the underlying form of the English past tense suffix?
   1. /d/
3. Both of the following statements adequately characterize the voicing alternation in Zoque. T/F?
   1. voiceless stops become voiced in post-nasal position [T]
   2. voiced stops become voiceless in word-initial position [F, no alternation]
4. Which of the following is the most common type of alternation in the worldâ€™s languages? [assimilation]
   1. Local vs Long-distance assimilation
5. Which of the following is posited as a reason for the ubiquity of the most common type of alternation?
   1. Local assimilation is ubiquitous because strong articulatory, perceptual, and processing requirements all favor it.  

# Phonotactics 

## Constraints

Language specific constraints on sound sequences (constraints are never language universal!)

- What sounds can occur in a particular position
- What sounds can occur next to each other

- **Static generalization**: Structure constraints **within a single morpheme**
   - Observe frequency of a certain pattern within a morpheme
   - Example: Nasal must agree in place of place of articulation with following stop
   - Example: Obstruent clusters must agree in voicing
- **Alternations**: different **variants** of morphemes
   1. Allophonic Alternation: allophone choice depends on phonotactic constraints.
      - **language wide** and not specific to a morpheme
      - e.g. voiceless plosives are only aspirated syllable initially, unaspirated elsewhere (is one surface form of [p, b, k] etc.!)
      - e.g. /l/ is only velarized (dark [l]) at the end of a syllable
   2. Allomorphic alternations (changes) or **Morphophonological alternations**
      - choice of the allomorph depends on the phonotactic constraints
      - Specific to that combination of morphemes
      - Object of analysis is a **morpheme** and its *allomorphs*
      - e.g. past tense suffix /d/, /t/, /id/, even though underlying form is /d/. syllable final /k/ + /d/ --> /kt/


## Alternations

Each morpheme has a single entry in the mental lexicon as the **underlying form**.

The different allomorphs (words pronounced) are the **surface forms**.

*Rules* **generate** the surface forms from underlying forms. Factors include:

- Phonological environments

### Morphophonological alternation vs Phonological alternation

Morpho-phonolgoical: Between two morphemes

Phonological: Between two phonemes (notice that this is a more general type of rule!)

To determine if there is phonological alternation when you have identified:
- Come up with the most similar morpho-phonological rules first
- Determine what is the phonological difference

### Assimilation

Two adjacent segments become more similar

- Voicing assimilation
- Place assimilation
- Nasal place assimilation
- Allophonic vowel nasalization
- Complete assimilation

### Long-distance assimilation or Harmony

Non-adjacent segments become more similar

- Vowel harmony (the most common kind)
- Consonant harmony
  - Chumash: sibilants in the word must share the same place.
- Tone harmony
  - African languages (e.g. Shona): Rightward spread of high tone.

### Coalescence

Two segments merge into one. **The segment demonstrates characteristics of both original**.

### Dissimilation

Segment changes to be less similar to an adjacent one. Purpose is to **reduce confusion** or
**ease of pronunciation**.

- Voicing dissimilation
- Fricative dissimilation
- Lateral dissimilation
- Rhotic dissimilation
- Long-distance dissimilation

### Lenition/Fortition

"Strength": **stops** $>$ **fricatives** $>$ taps or rhotics $>$ **all sonorants** $>$ [h] or glottal stop

Lenition (Reduction) is **weakening**, fortition is **strengthening**

- Consonant lenition
- Post-nasal hardening
- Stress

### Debuccalization

Any consonant becomes a glottal stop (losing its oral articulation).

### Epenthesis

Hiatus: Two vowels from different syllables come next to each other.

Epenthesis is good at remedying hiatus

### Lengthening and Shortening

Lengthening

- Compensatory lengthening
  - When a **deletion** occurs, the preceding  vowel lengthens to make up for the loss

Shortening: long segment becomes short.

- closed syllable shortening: shortening to avoid long (CVVC) vowel in a closed syllable.
  - e.g. Yowlumne syllable structure: 
    - (Control) Short vowels: [xat-al] -> [xa.tal], [xat-hin] -> [xat.hin], 
    - [laan-al] -> [laa.nal] AVOIDED, [laan-hin] -> [lan.hin] (USED HERE)

### Metathesis

Segment/syllables switching order.

Can be local or long distance

## Morphophonological alternations

e.g. Nasal assismilation in Zoque only applies to prefixes but not within words.

e.g. Nasal assimilation is obligatory for "in-" ("imbalance" vs "insanity"), but optional for "un-" ("unbalanced").
(some pronounce [un], others [um].)
