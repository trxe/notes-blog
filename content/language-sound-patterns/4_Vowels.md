# Vowels

This week's questions:
1. The most basic syllable type crosslinguistically is
  - CV
2. Vowels usually form the _ of a syllable.
  - nucleus
3. There are _ primary cardinal vowels.
  - 8
4. The crosslinguistically most common vowel system contains which vowels?
  - [i e a o u]
5. Which of the following is usually described as an ‘r-ful’ variety of English?
  - American English


Open articulations: active and passive articulators never contact

Points in a multi-d space (coords are **articulatory** or **acoustic**).

## Background

The most basic syllable type is CV:
- C: consonant (constriction)
- V: vowel (release)

**Syllable**: a grouing of segments

![](/notes-blog/assets/img/speech/syllable.png)

- Onset: preceding
- Nucleus: the most **open articulation**
  - Sometimes a consonant is the loudest, then it is marked as a **syllabic consonant** with a vertical line underneath
- Coda: succeeding

Syllables alternate between more and less prominent (stress). A varties of parameters can be used.
- Pitch
- Loudness
- Length etc.

Vocal tract is asymmetrical. We aren't very good at telling where the back of our tongues are.
- "High" or "Back" refers to what a vowel sounds like.

## Cardinal vowels

Jones 18 cardinal vowels with 8 **primary cardinal vowels**, 1, 5, 8 being the extreme positions:

![](/notes-blog/assets/img/speech/vowels_cardinal.png)

Note: Cardinals 9 to 18 are just the rounded/unrounded counterparts.

They are not actual vowels of a particular language, but they are just reference points for orientation in the vowel space.

**Cardinal vowels don't appear in any language as it is super precise.**

**No two vowels have the same physical height**.

- Vowels are not exact, no contact btwn active and passive articulators
- Other cardinal vowels are 'auditorily equidistant' between 3 extremes
  - See the "leaf shape"
- Actual tongue position producing various cardinal vowels aren't articulatorily equidistant

## Dimensions

How to count how many degrees are required? Find the number of coinciding

### Height/Backness

The [i e a o u] will probably not be the same as Jones' cardinal vowels.

-  If the vowel system is small/basic, the "space" each vowel occupies before they become indistinguishable is large
-  Vowel height is the **most important** parameter in describing vowels
   -  Vertical vowel systems typically only contrast 2 or 3 vowels
    -  Height is the only parameter required to distinguish vowels in vowel system
- In a typical 5 vowel system:
  - [a] is usually produced quite centrally, but we don't need another position as usually no other vowel contrasts with it. (same height)
  - vowels are **maximally distributed in the vowel space**

### Tense/Laxness

- The definition tends to be fuzzy, so **no one measure holds for all languages**
- Tense/lax in English
  - leave [liv] vs live [lɪv]
  - tense vowels are **higher/longer** than the lax in English
- BUT not in Akan
  - tense and lax vowels are not contrasting in height
  - Instead, advanced/retracted tongue root
    - Forward --> tongue go up (which is why tense tends to be higher) and vice versa.
- Typically foudn only in mid/high
- Low vowels don't really have
  - muscle tension raises the tongue body but body has to be lowered for low vowels.

### Rounding

- Rounding and backing both enlarge the front cavity
  - back rounded is unmarked
- Front the tongue and spreading the lips shrink the front cavity
  - fron unrounded is unmarked
- Low vowels are rarely rounded:
  - [ɒ] is marked instead of it's unrounded counterpart. its only used in RP

### 'r-ful'-ness

GA (General American) is r-ful: stressed vowel before the r

r-dropping

### schwa [ə] vs wedge [ʌ]

- schwa: **unstressed** neutral vowel
- wedge: **stressed** non-front, non-round, mid vowel

In unstressed syllables with orthographic “r”, rhotic dialects have [schwa with a curl], non-rhotic
have [schwa].

You will never find a tap on a stressed syllable.

Conventions for central vowels:
- with **no orthographic r**, stressed central vowel is transcribed with wedge.
  - Even though the pronunciation sounds more like a schwa
  - the unstressed vowel is using the schwa instead.

### Low vowel contrasts

## Vowel nasality and voice quality

- Nasality: tilde above
- Voice quality:
  - devoiced: underdot
    - unstressed vowels after aspirated stops can be voiceless! (e.g. potato in GA, narrow transcription)
  - creaky: tilde below
  - breathy: umlaut below

Coarticulation: overlap in the articulatory gestures
- anticipatory coarticulation
- if a nasal consonant is anticipated, you have to open the velar port and nasalize the vowel! e.g. [pæn]

For every nasal vowel, there is a non-nasal vowel: nasal vowels are marked.
- nasal tracts dampens acoustic cues differentiating the vowels
- Extra resonance of the nasal cavity interferes with the acoustics of tongue/lip
- so nasal vowels are harder to distinguish

## Length and diphthongs

### Diphthongs

Require a change in tongue and lip position throughout it's duration.

Dipthongs are longer than dipthongized vowels generally, but
crucially must **change tongue position** in constrast with diphthongized vowels.

The difference between diphthongs and diphthongized vowels is that 
in a true diphthong, deleting the **offglide** (second part) changes the meaning of the word.

e.g. [kait] vs [kat] and [waʊnd] vs [wand]

Voice quality contrasts tend to be more marked on vowels because vowels are necessarily voiced.

Different **tension** in the vocal folds WILL be observable.


## Tone

Voice quality contrasts tend to be more marked on vowels because vowels are necessarily voiced.

Different **frequency** in the vocal folds WILL be observable.

tone is a property of the unity larger than a segment, usually syllable/word.
BUT the diff in pitch is the clearest at the vowel.

stressed vowels tend to have higher pitch

questions have rising pitch, statements have falling pitch

Tonal language: 

![](/notes-blog/assets/img/speech/tones.png)

**Level tones**: flat levels [Register tone languages only have levels]

**Contour tones**: Crucial pitch rising/falling 
[are marked! you expect languages with contour tones to have level tones too]

Chao tone levels
