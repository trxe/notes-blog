# Vowels

This week's questions:
1. The most basic syllable type crosslinguistically is
  - CV
2. Vowels usually form the _ of a syllable.
  - nucleus
3. There are _ primary cardinal vowels.
  - 8
4. The crosslinguistically most common vowel system contains which vowels?
  - [i e a o u]
5. Which of the following is usually described as an ‘r-ful’ variety of English?
  - American English


Open articulations: active and passive articulators never contact

Points in a multi-d space (coords are **articulatory** or **acoustic**).

## Background

The most basic syllable type is CV:
- C: consonant (constriction)
- V: vowel (release)

**Syllable**: a grouing of segments

- Onset: preceding
- Nucleus: the most **open articulation**
  - Sometimes a consonant is the loudest, then it is marked as a **syllabic consonant** with a vertical line underneath
- Coda: succeeding

Syllables alternate between more and less prominent (stress). A varties of parameters can be used.
- Pitch
- Loudness
- Length etc.

Vocal tract is asymmetrical. We aren't very good at telling where the back of our tongues are.
- "High" or "Back" refers to what a vowel sounds like.

## Cardinal vowels

Jones 18 cardinal vowels with 8 **primary cardinal vowels**, 1, 5, 8 being the extreme positions:

Note: Cardinals 9 to 18 are just the rounded/unrounded counterparts.

## Dimensions

### Height/Backness

The [i e a o u] may not be the same as Jones' cardinal vowels.A

-  If the vowel system is small/basic, the "space" each vowel occupies before they become indistinguishable is large

### Tense/Laxness

- Tense/lax in English or more extreme, Akan
  - leave [liv] vs live [lɪv]
- tense vowels are **higher/longer** than the lax
- Advanced/retracted tongue root
  - Forward --> tongue go up (which is why tense tends to be higher) and vice versa.

### Rounding

- Rounding and backing both enlarge the front cavity
  - back rounded is unmarked
- Front the tongue and spreading the lips shrink the front cavity
  - fron unrounded is unmarked

### 'r-ful'-ness

GA (General American) is r-ful: stressed vowel before the r

r-dropping

### schwa [ə] vs wedge [ʌ]

- schwa: **unstressed** neutral vowel
- wedge: **stressed** non-front, non-round, mid vowel

In unstressed syllables with orthographic “r”, rhotic dialects have [schwa with a curl], non-rhotic
have [schwa].

### Low vowel contrasts

## Vowel nasality and voice quality

- Nasality: tilde above
- Voice quality:
  - devoiced: underdot
    - unstressed vowels after aspirated stops can be voiceless! (e.g. potato in GA, narrow transcription)
  - creaky: tilde below
  - breathy: umlaut below

Extra resonance of the nasal cavity interferes with the acoustics of tongue/lip: 
so nasal vowels are harder to distinguish

## Length and diphthongs

Dipthongs and dipthongized vowels

## Tone

tone is a property of the unity larger than a segment, usually syllable/word.
BUT the diff in pitch is the clearest at the vowel.

stressed vowels tend to have higher pitch

questions have rising pitch, statements have falling pitch
