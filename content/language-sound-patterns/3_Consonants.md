# Consonants

This week's answers:
1. Shaded areas in the IPA chart denote articulations that are deemed physically impossible. T/F?
   - True
2. Empty, unshaded areas in the IPA chart denote articulations that are physically possible, but not attested in the world’s languages. T/F?
   - True
3. There are languages in the world that use all the sounds represented in the IPA. T/F?
   - False (?)
4. Which of the following types of consonants is/are non-pulmonic?
   - Pulmonic sounds: sounds initiated by means of the lungs
5. Which type of click is rarest crosslinguistically?
   - Bilabial click


## Exotic Sounds and phonetic environment

Consonant IPA chart can be broken down into
- Pulmonic consonants
- Non-pulmonic consonants
- Other symbols
- Diacritics
  - Partial voicing/Slight raising, lowering/More, less rounding etc.

Important facts:
- Place of articulation form **columns**
- manner of articulation forms **rows**
- Empty boxes are not found in any language
- Shaded boxes are deemed impossible

**Environment**: The place in a word where the sound occurs
- Initial
- Medial
- Final

The environment may introduce variation in how a sound in pronounced.
- If 2 different sounds occur in the same environment
- And results in two different words
- The two words form a *minimal pair* and the **sounds are contrastive**.

## Stops, nasals and fricatives (Obstruents + nasals)

- Languages generally choose **either bilabial or labiodental fricatives** as part of their inventory
  - because few languages contrast these fricatives (hard to hear difference)
  - **Ewe** in West Africa constrasts all (four labial fricatives)

- The **coronal (dental/alveolar/post-alveolar)** stops/nasals
  - [t, d, n] spread across all 3 places
    - dental variant: [t$_\sqcap$, d$_\sqcap$, n$_\sqcap$]
    - alveolar: [t,d,n]
    - post-alveolar variant: [t$_\_$, d$_\_$, n$_\_$]
  - languages generally only choose one of these places to use contrastively
  - the same symbol is used across all three regions here for each manner
  - not many languages contrast dental and alveolar
    - Exception: Malayalam and New Guinea
      - Alveolar made with tongue tip (apical)
      - Dental made with tongue blade (laminal)

English coronal stops and nasals are alveolar by default.

However, **positional variants** include the dental/post-alveolar versions.

- The **coronal** fricatives
    - Different symbols because often used contrastively.
    - [s, z, ʃ, ʒ] (alveolar, post-alveolar fricatives) are **grooved fricatives**
      - Groove in tongue creates channel of airflow (center lowered, sides raised)
      - aka **sibilants**
      - [ʃ] is more rounded than [s] $\Rightarrow$ bigger channel $\Rightarrow$ lower pitch.
    - [θ, ð] (dental fricatives) are **not**: tongue flat

- Retroflex
  - Curled back tongue tip versions of the other coronals.
  - Hindi has retroflex stops, fricatives and nasals

- Palatals
  - Raising the tongue front and tongue body to the front palate.
