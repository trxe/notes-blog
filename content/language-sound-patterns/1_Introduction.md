# Introduction

## Phonetics (Part 1)

Articulatory phonetics:
- how speech sounds are produced in mouth
- basis of phonology

Acoustic phonetics:
- study of acoustic signals
- spectrograms

Auditory phonetics:
- studying of hearing and perception
- ear and brain

## Phonology (Part 2)

How languages organize sounds into different patterns

Goal is to understand the rules of sound patterns (grammar)

- Organizing sounds

# Articulatory Phonetics

Vocal tract:
- Sub-laryngeal (sub-glottal) = Below the larynx at throat
- larynx = Throat
- supra-larygeal = Above, many organs

The whole vocal tract is secondarily adapted for speech 
(because they serve other biological functions, and they are found in other species)

<div class="question">
Why are we the only species to have adapted for speech?

Visualiztion
- Dissection
- Imaging (X-ray, ultrasound, magnetic resonance)
  - X-ray not common: Dangerous, teeth are hard tissue and in the way, soft tissue pass through
  - Ultrasound: Cheaper, easier, safer
  - MRI: Clearest but most expensive
