# Introduction

## Phonetics (Part 1)

Articulatory phonetics:
- how speech sounds are produced in mouth
- basis of phonology

Acoustic phonetics:
- study of acoustic signals
- spectrograms

Auditory phonetics:
- studying of hearing and perception
- ear and brain

## Phonology (Part 2)

How languages organize sounds into different patterns

Goal is to understand the rules of sound patterns (grammar)

- Organizing sounds

# Articulatory Phonetics

Vocal tract:
- Sub-laryngeal (sub-glottal) = Below the larynx at throat
- larynx = Throat
- supra-larygeal = Above, many organs

The whole vocal tract is secondarily adapted for speech 
(because they serve other biological functions, and they are found in other species)

<div class="question">
Why are we the only species to have adapted for speech?
</div>

**Visualiztion**
- Dissection
- Imaging (X-ray, ultrasound, magnetic resonance)
  - X-ray not common: Dangerous, teeth are hard tissue and in the way, soft tissue pass through
  - Ultrasound: Cheaper, easier, safer
  - MRI: Clearest but most expensive

**Airstream Mechanisms**
- **Pulmmonic** (lung) **Egressive** (outward) airstream mechanism
  - Inhaling: Diaphragm flatterns --> Lungs expand --> Vol up --> pressure decrease --> draw air in.
  - Exhaling: Opposite
- There are other tyeps of airstream mechanisms!

## State of Larynx

Larynx: Pitch and voicing
- Vocal folds
  - Vocalis muscle
  - Glottis (is it open/closed)
    - Space between the vocal folds
    - Glottal stop (Holding breath): When pulled together vocal cords tightly, traps air below the vocal folds
  - Vocal ligament

When no vocal folds are moving, any sounds created are voiceless sounds
{fundamental frequency, F0}

Rate of vibration of vocal folds determines pitch 
- No vibration = no pitch.
- Faster vibration, higher pitch
- Larger vocal folds = Vibrate more slowly = Lower pitch
- More stretched out = More tense = Higher pitch (Pulling vocal folds very tight)

## Active and Passive Articulators

![Some Passive Articulators](/notes-blog/assets/img/speech/passive_articulators.png)

Shaping of the air is in the supra-larygeal vocal tract.
- Active articulators (lower lip, tongue) move during speech
  - technically larynx but it is not supra-laryngeal and doesn't move towards a passive articulator
- Passive articulators (everything else)
  - Velum aka soft palate can be moved but it is a passive articulator cos tongue moves towards it
  - Velum is typically used for controlling between nasal/vocal

### Why are we the only speakers?

Hypothesis 1: **Anatomical** changes
- Larynx is lower than our closest relatives
  - Chimpanzees and bonobos
  - Comparison with the position of the hyoid bone
  - Our larynx has descennded at some point
- Descended larynx = stretches out pharynx
  - Bigger pharyngeal space at the bac of the mouth to produce bigger variety of speech sounds

Babies cannot talk
- Babies can start babbling (first speech sounds) after the larynx descends
- Speech seems to only start to develop after larynx descends??

BUT some animals have **permanently** descended larynx too,
and some mammals can **temporarily** lower larynx

Hypothesis 2: **Behavioural** changes
- Development of language and speech
  - Caused humans to permanently adopt that lowered position

Archeological records:
- Paleontology: Homo erectus/sapiens (500k -- 200k years ago) already had requisite anatomy for speech
- Some form of language must have existed for dispersion from Africa (>50k years ago)
- Earliest form of written language (5k years ago)

<div class="question">
Why haven't primates evolved to lower their larynx?
</div>

Disadvantage of lowered larynx
- Increased risk of choking (food entering windpipe)
  - In humans, epiglottis and velum **never** touch
  - In primates, epiglottis and velum actually overlap 
    - And when swallowing, velum lifts to block the windpipe
