# The sounds of language

Language is:
- Discrete
- Combinatorial
- Unbounded
- Recursive

Each vocal tract movement = an **articulatory gesture**.
To define an articulatory gesture,

- Airstream mechanism
- State of the velar port
- State of the larynx
- **Place** of articulation (where the articulator moves)
- **Manner** of articulation (type of constriction made)

## Transcription

- English does not have good sound-letter correspondence
- Many logographic languages do not have sound-letter correspondence at all
- Phonetic transcription cannot be restricted by one language
  - Xhosa's `"X" !=` Xu's `"X"`

### International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)

1. Universal alphabet (every human language can be represented)
2. Unambiguous (one-to-one sounds-symbols)

#### Types of transcription

- Broad transcription: Basic symbols only to distinguish words
  - **Contrastive** aspects: different symbols <=> different words
- Narrow transcription: Articulatory Details (often via diacriticals + basic symbol)
  - Contrastive and non-contrastive 

## Building blocks of speech

### Airstream, Larynx, Velum

Airstream: By DEFAULT, is **pulmonic egressive** (unmarked).
The limited case is marked

**Laryngeal:** State of vocal folds [**Vibrating**, **Closed**, **Open**]

- Voiced/voiceless [z/s]: If vocal folds are vibrating it is voiced.
- Aspiration (extra voicelessness): How large the vocal fold opening is
  - Test by feeling air in front of mouth
  - Glottal stop: shutting the folds down cutting airflow in larynx
- Nasality/orality: Velum open/closed

### Manner of articulation

3 types of audible air:
1. Pop [obstruent]
2. Turbulence [obstruent]
3. Resonance [sonorant]

**Obstruent**: Obstruction to the flow of air
- Plosives (oral stops) [p,b,k,t]
  - bring active and passive articulators together to stop air from exiting the mouth
- Fricatives [f,s]
  - articulators are brought close but not completely
  - narrow slit to force air through (hiss)
- Affricates [ch]
  - STOP --> FRICATIVE

Voicing vs obstruents:
- Voicing requires airflow through
