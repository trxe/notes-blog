# The sounds of language

Language is:
- Discrete
- Combinatorial
- Unbounded
- Recursive

Each vocal tract movement = an **articulatory gesture**.
To define an articulatory gesture,

- Airstream mechanism
  - Pulmonary egressive, Glottalic egressive, Glottalic ingressive, Velaric ingressive
- State of the velar port
  - Closed: Oral sounds
  - Open: Air can pass through the nose, Nasal sounds
- State of the larynx
- **Place** of articulation (where the articulator moves)
- **Manner** of articulation (type of constriction made)

### Place of articulation

**Active** articulator: the "**mover**" articulator

- Lower lip (labial)
- Tongue front (coronal)
- Tongue body
- Larynx

**Passive** articulator: the **place** to which the active articulator moves


| **Active Articulator** | **+ Passive Articulator** | **= Place of Articulation** |
|------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| lower lip              | upper lip                 | labial                      |
|                        | upper teeth               | labio-dental                |
| tongue front           | upper teeth               | dental                      |
|                        | alveolar ridge            | alveolar                    |
|                        | post-alveolar region      | retroflex (tip)             |
|                        | post-alveolar region      | post-alveolar (blade)       |
| tongue body            | hard palate               | palatal                     |
|                        | soft palate               | velar                       |
| larynx                 |                           | laryngeal                   |

**Building descriptors**: 

| PLACE | Voiced/Voiceless/Nasal | MANNER |  |
|-------|------------------------|--------|--|
| bilabial | nasal | plosive/stop | m |
| dental | voiceless | fricative | θ |

## Transcription

- English does not have good sound-letter correspondence
- Many logographic languages do not have sound-letter correspondence at all
- Phonetic transcription cannot be restricted by one language
  - Xhosa's `"X" !=` Xu's `"X"`

### International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)

1. Universal alphabet (every human language can be represented)
2. Unambiguous (one-to-one sounds-symbols)

#### Types of transcription

- Broad transcription: Basic symbols only to distinguish words
  - **Contrastive** aspects: different symbols <=> different words
- Narrow transcription: Articulatory Details (often via diacriticals + basic symbol)
  - Contrastive and non-contrastive 

## Building blocks of speech

### Airstream, Larynx, Velum

Airstream: By DEFAULT, is **pulmonic egressive** (unmarked).
The limited case is marked

<div class="question">What exactly is "marked"?</div>

**Laryngeal:** State of vocal folds [**Vibrating**, **Closed**, **Open**]

- **Voiced/voiceless** [z/s]: If vocal folds are vibrating it is voiced.
- **Aspiration** [$^h$] (extra voicelessness): How large the vocal fold opening is
  - Test by feeling air in front of mouth
  - **Glottal stop** [ʔ]: shutting the folds down cutting airflow in larynx
- **Nasality/orality** [e.g. m]: Velum open/closed
- **Creaky/Relaxed**: vocal folds are tense/relaxed

### Manner of articulation

3 types of audible air:
1. Pop [obstruent]
2. Turbulence [obstruent]
3. Resonance [sonorant]

**Obstruent**: Obstruction to the flow of air

- Plosives (oral stops) [p,b,k,t]
  - bring active and passive articulators together to stop air from exiting the mouth
- Fricatives [e.g. f,s]
  - articulators are brought close but not completely
  - narrow slit to force air through (hiss)
- Affricates [ch]
  - STOP --> FRICATIVE

Many obstruents are **voiceless**.

Voiced obstruents (stops/fricatives) are **marked**.
- e.g. [b, d, g], [v, ð, z, ʒ]
- Voicing requires airflow through
- But obstruents block it.
- Hence more difficult and unconventional --> marked.

**Sonorant**: No buildup of pressure in vocal tract, we allow it to free flow and vibrate at different frequencies.

- Vowels
- Nasal stops [m]
  - Counts as a stop as lips are closed
  - No buildup/burst of pressure
- Approximants [r, l]:
  - Active articulator narrows the vocal tract, but not so much as the *fricative*
  - [r]: class of rhotics
  - [l]: class of laterals (air flow through side)

### On approximants (laterals, trills, taps, flaps)

Laterals: stops the airflow down the centre of the vocal tract, air flow through side

- Dark [l] (l with tilde through centre): occurs when [l] is after a high vowel (e.g. feel, heal, pool)
- Lateral fricatives: a tighter constriction at the sides and/or more airflow
- Labial laterals are impossible.

Taps [up-down] and flaps [one-way] are often rhotics.

Approximants: constriction in the vocal tract

Most sonorants are **voiced**.
- Blowing out air --> vibration --> basics of sonorance

Unvoiced sonorants are marked

### Contour vs complex segments

Contour segments: Start with one manner and end with another manner

Complex segments: 2 places of articulation are used at the same time


### Vowels

Determined by **tongue position**.

- Height (high/low/mid)
- Frontness (front/central/back)
- Rounded/unrounded
- Schwa (the reduced vowel): Short unstressed syllables.

![Vowels IPA chart](/notes-blog/assets/img/speech/ipa_vowels.png)

"Offglides"
- Non-contrastive ("bade/bode": [beɪd/boʊd])
- Contrastive ("find/found": [aɪ/aʊ]) 
  - **Diphthongs**
