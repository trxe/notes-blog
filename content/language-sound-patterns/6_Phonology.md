# Phonology

Units that cannot be substituted for each other without changing meaning: **contrastive distribution** 
(a minimal pair is a pair demonstrating the above).

**Phoneme**: A set of sounds that considered equivalent pronunciations of the same **underlying representation**.

**Allophones**: Sound in the set of the phoneme.

| Contrastive Distribution | Complementary Distribution |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Unpredictable            | Predictable                |
| Separate phonemes        | Allophone of same phoneme  |

These differ across languages, though cross linguistic patterns may exist.

## Allophones

relatively similar sounds that are in **complementary distribution** (i.e. non-overlapping environments).

Observation of complementary distribution: **high likelihood of allophones of same phoneme**.

Phonological distributions depend on **natural classes**: sets of sounds that have something in common

If complementary distribution but no **phonetic similarity** or **cannot** form natural class: **not allophone**.

**Free variation**: 2 or more sounds in the same environment with **no change in meaning** and **both considered correct**.

- i.e. neither contrastive or complemeentary
- but are allophones
