# 3D Modelling and Animation

- Analysis of surface quality

- Surface smoothing -- noise removal: How do you know what is noise and what isn't

- Parameterization - chunking

- Simplifying the model to reduce complexity (reduce triangles)

- Remeshing to improve regularity, esp for engineering purposes for stress testing etc (adding triangles)

- Freeform/Multiresolution modelling: as the object moves closer, the models will have jump in resolution

- Simplifying/Remeshing

**Acquiring**

**Analyzing**
