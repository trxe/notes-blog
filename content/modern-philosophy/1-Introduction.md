# Founders of Modern Philosophy

[https://earlymoderntexts.com]

Texts used:

- Anthony Kenny -- The Rise of Modern Philosophy [https://blog.oup.com/2007/06/anthony_kenny]

There is great irony in learning historical philosophical texts.
From Descartes "Discourse on the Method",
- "We see that it hardly ever happens that readers of great philosophers hardly ever surpass them"
- The ivy that grows down

What do you expect the history of philosophy to be worth?
How to discern what is worthwhile and what is not, when the philosophers and great and iconic at times and sometimes may be just wrong.

> "It is true that Descartes initiated a new, individualistic..."

Medieval: transmit knowledge Christian corpus (Orthodox)
- Acquinas (bible is congruent with Aristotle)
- Ockham
- Scotus

Renaissance: rediscover and republicize knowledge from pagan philosophy

## Picture of early modern philosophy 

(up to start of 19th century)

**Rationalism**: knowledge comes only from reason. "Animals with brains and no eyes"
- Rene Descartes
- Baruch Spinoza
- Gottfried Leibniz

**Empiricism**: knowledge comes only thru senses. "Animals with eyes and no brains"
- Locke
- Berkeley
- Hume

**Immanuel Kant**
Higher synthesis: empiricism + reason

Pantheism controversy

## Epistemology

What is knowledge? *see Philosophy of mind*.

Modern philosophy includes issues 
- **authority** 
- **justification**
- leading to **epistemology** (knowledge and sicence) and **politics**

what makes a claim authoritative (since justified/just)

Starting with Descartes: Meditations

- The Treaty of Westphalia (Thirty years war, Eighty years war ended)
  - Religious Wars follow the reformation 
  - Westphalian sovereignty/myth (just tired? or does the treaty have some innovation in political thought)
  - secularisation of nations becoming nature after collapse of religious unanimity
  - *see Glorious Revolution*

End? with Kant's Critique of Pure Reason/Critique of Judgement

- The French Revolution
  - On behalf of enlihtenment philosophy
  - Revolution --> Napoleonic  Wars

## POLITICS VER.

1. machiavelli
2. hobbes
3. spinoza
4. locke
5. montesquieu
6. voltaire **Skepticism**
7. rousseau
8. adam smith
9. burke
10. marx

Transition towards politics should be based on knowledge of things (legitimacy comes from nature)

Encyclopdie: The Democratization of Knowledge

who's this robert filmer dude

## SCIENCE VER. (from rationalist to empiricist)

1.  descartes
2.  spinoza
3.  leibniz
4.  kepler
5.  copernicus
6.  newton
7.  kant
8.  galileo
9.  locke
10. (berkeley)
11. (hume)

Science = knowledge until mid 19th century. Before that it was mostly knownas "Natural philosophy"

Science rests on bold imaginative guesses based on creative visions imposed on the facts (is this solid?)
whats the diff between a crazy bold guesser and a scientific bold guesser?

## Naturalistic view of the world

1. Enlightenism: progression by harnessing nature.
2. Nihilism: war of all against all.

Is our true nature to know or to fight one another?

## Duality in the accounts of science

Make observations, or rationalise?

Einstein:

1. Matter is real to my senses, but they aren't trustworthy
2. We cannot say anything of value by purely logical reasoning
- Pure reason doesn't contribute substance, they only are valid or not
- You can't process nothing

Something happens for no reason? Determinism vs probabilistic "God doesn't play dice"

- General relativity: big heavy stuff
- Quantum mechaniscs: small tiny stuff
- Consistency: planck shit? but something is contradicting btwn the two now
- must there be one theory of everything (TOE) that unifies the two.
  - what is the relation btwn GR and QM
  - so must we end up with a axiomatic final physical truth that is self-evident????
    - why?
    - so we have something we can agree to base everything upon. otherwise no shared truth
    - Opinion: the truth must be rational
-  an isomorphism btwn the unds of reason within my mind vs the unds of reasoning in the greater world out there

is skepticism seem intuitively right? or is it intuitively wrong?

interesting: is this of value and creates a point?
true: obv??
