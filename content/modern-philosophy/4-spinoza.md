# A Vibes-Based Overview of Spinoza's Philosophy

## Pantheism

According to Pantheism, everything is God and God is everything.

- You've collapsed the difference between God and his creation
- Is pantheism consistent with bible scripture?
- Orthodox  C. transcendency
- But modern era C.

Is Spinoza a pantheist? Here are some of his beliefs

- Pantheism is not obviously atheist. So it flewunder the radar
- God cannot be anthromorphized
- **God doesn't want anything from us.**
- Spinoza denies evil: Theodicy
  - **As such he is denying sin**
- He also denied **miracles**
  - Departures from natural order
  - Natural order is a creation by god.

Science?

- Foundational science: Mathematical, rock solid bases that are perfectly general
- 'All the science is either physics or stamp collecting'. These rather controversial statement is attributed to Ernest Rutherford.
  - Cartesian
  - Individual, seeks confirmation and validity
- Science is constantly fallible.
  - Fallibly extending hypotheses and then disconfirming
  - Fallibalism can be rigorous
  - Science is a group effort by humans
  - Operating on 
  - Neurath's ship

1. Substance Monism
   1. There's only 1 thing in the world
   2. GE. QM. there must be a TOE. They cannot stand as brute facts.
   3. otherwise, PSE violated
   4. TOE must be self-evident
   5. Otherwise again, PSE violated
   6. TOE doesn't cause the universe, it is the universe
   8. Otherwise the PSE is violated
   9. Nothing enforces the law. It just is
   10. Ultimately there is 1 unified thing.
2. Theory of Mind
   1. If there is only 1 substance,
   2. then both mind and matter must be the aspects of the same substance.
   3. There must be a common denominator: the **shared order of reasons**
   4. Why would the mind interact with the matter? They don't!
      1. Cannot bc they interact with different spaces.
   5. PARALLELISM: the Substance causes both the mind and matter to move at once
   6. Mind and body reflect each other and executing at the same time
   7. Isn't this arbitrary? 
      1. No because it obeys naturally the monist principle of the world
   8. Mind and matter are isomorphic.
   9. **ProbelM**: What about other minds.
3. "It from Bit" (John Wheeler)
   1. We need to treat physics as info
   2. Reality is created by observers in the universe
   3. Leibniz?
4. Psychology: Conatus (striving. SElf-Preservation)
   1. Everything in existence strives to stay in existing.
   2. Inertia.
5. Ethics: Enlightened self-interest
   1. Egotism
   2. Staying in existence being in line with your understanding of good.
6. Politics and Religion:
