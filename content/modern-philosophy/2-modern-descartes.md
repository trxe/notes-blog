# Modern Philosophy and Descartes' Meditations

1. Skepticism (radical skepticism: we have serious misconceptions about something)
   1. Epistemology
   2. Politics (redpilled)
      1. Do humans have natural rights? If you talked to Thomas Acquinas about natural rights, he wouldn't know what you're talking about.

### Anthony Kenny: Sixteenth Century Philosophy

### Rationalism vs Empiricism

Battle for authority

**Viewpoints**

1. Final reasons for why things are must be rational
   1. Science is a purely rational structure
   2. There is a theory of everything in the world. It has to be a self-verifying truth or *Theory of Everything* in the world.
2. Science is merely scouring observations and piecing them together

How come GPT can seem so brilliant one minute and so breathtakingly dumb the next.
- GPT inherits human fallacies
- Generates things people find plausible but being an AGI doesn't have a way to verify answers
- "Dream-like" state?
- Weird chain of inductive reasonings, without any rationalising
  - The world's greatest sophist: King of pastiche
  - But what about wikipedia? Just a remixing of information too.

Give it back it's own product and ask it to reconsider.

## Descartes

Descartes thought that science was meant to be an individual endeavour, drawing parallels 
to a masterpiece created by a single person is more perfect and complete than one that is
created in multiple parts by multiple people.

Chandoux example: Pastiche of ideas how to mix it all up and spew it back out, was applauded

Descartes understood it's not a way of actually building knowledge.

Opinion: ChatGPT is not knowledge, but Wikipedia is knowledge.
    - Wikipedia is not infallible
    - but it's not susceptible to crazy ideas and is peer reviewed that is 

### EmpiricismGPT or RationalismGPT

How to make chatGPT into a knowledge base, instead of a bullshit engine?

ChatGPT: is a strategy to produce knowledge, but it's really a plausibility engine.

Descartes is **eliminating** all our plausible knowledge except the ones we know for certain.

Galileo's Tower: 
- Thought experiment
- Aristotle proposed heavy things falls faster than light things
- but nobody tested it.
- Galileo not only tested it with experiment
- but made a logical argument
    - Heavier + light object tied together to make an even heavier object, so it should hit the ground faster
    - The light object should slow it down
    - So we have a contradiction.

## Meditations 1

1. Wipe the slate clean of all "things i think are probably true", prove they can be plausibly false.
2. Assume that senses mislead me
   1. Don't trust about small distant objects
   2. Trust big near objects
3. What about dreams?
   1. Just cos I'm dreaming sometimes, doesn't mean I'm dreaming all the time.
   2. How do I know when I'm dreaming or not?
   3. My tests for whether I'm dreaming or not can always be distorted! 
4. Even dreams are based on reality.
   1. Suppose my whole existence is designed to make me have false beliefs (evil demon)
   2. Can I prove this is the case?
   3. Would there be anything I believe that's true?
5. Science is impossible cos science cannot exist!!

**Knowledge:** Justified, true belief.
- if you are in a bad way, knowledge wise, you can't tell you're in a bad way knowledge wise.
- even if you arein a good way, you can't be sure you are.
- even if you have **true beliefs**, that is insufficient to have **knowledge**.
- Justification to the highest level (I haven't checked the highest level)
- What if science is fallible? My results **are** always fallible.
- Standard of justification short of science? Such specification is hard.

## Meditations 2

cogito ergo sum (cogito, sum: the thought has kind of a self-verifying existence)

three alleged positive results:
1. Epistemic result: The mind is better known than the body.
   1. "There is a hand here (probably true)" vs "I think there is a hand here (definitely true)"
2. Metaphysical result: The mind is the thinking thing and the bodies are extensions.
   1. An ontological claim rgding the mind
   2. The wax argument?
   3. There are physical objects that you can transform (with heat etc.) but yet you believe it is the same thing.
   4. Descartes is moving towards his physics: the universe is one big piece of wax.
   5. Bodies exist through time, but are extended through space
   6. Thoughts too exist through time, but are NOT extended through space.
3. Methodological result: **doubt itself** is a positive tool for construction too! 
   1. It doesn't just dissolves beliefs.
   2. You boil away possibilities to get true essence

But I still don't know bodies exist!
- "God won't deceive me" ??????
- deus ex machina
