Analysis of surface quality

Surface smoothing -- noise removal: How do you know what is noise and what isn't

Parameterization - chunking

Simplifying the model to reduce complexity (reduce triangles)

Remeshing to improve regularity, esp for engineering purposes for stress testing etc (adding triangles)

Freeform/Multiresolution modelling: as the object moves closer, the models will have jump in resolution
