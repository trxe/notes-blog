Voronoi

Given a map and some vertices

HOw to divide that map such that each region contains the points with that vertex as the closest.

Intersections of all the bisected spaces between every 2 points.

1. Every point in S has a non-empty Voronoi region
2. Every Voronoi is convex
3. Voronoi region can be bound or unbound. It is unbound if the point is on the convex hull



Delaunay triangulation

2D: draw a line btwn 2 vertices if their's voronoi regions share an edge.

3D: draw a line btween 2 vertices if their voronoi regions share a face.
