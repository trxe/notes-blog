# Model of human linguistic computation

![Model of computation](/notes-blog/assets/img/syntax/comp-ling.png)

1. **lexicon + X-bar** conspire to form **the base**
2. **theta criterion** constrains the base to form **D-structure**
3. **transformational rules** transform **D-structure** into **S-structure**

## $V \rightarrow T$ movement

- Case 1: 
  - Je mange souvent des pommes 
  - (I eat often of.the apples) 
  - "I eat apples often"
  - Je ne-mange pas des pommes
  - I eat not of.the apples
  - "I did not eat the apples"
- Case 2: VSO verb structure
  - Phog Maire an lucharachan 
  - (Kissed Mary the leprechaun)
  - "Mary kissed the leprechaun"

Hypothesis: 
- Initial D-structure is always SVO.
- V is raised into the T position
  - For all tensed verbs
  - For tensed auxiiliaries
  - This is controlled by the **Verb-Movement parameter**

To find evidence, look at 

1. SOV languages with possible SVO sentences (e.g. Vata)
2. Presence of terms between V and complement NP.

Doesn't solve the issue of VSO. Requires:

- Null Active verb being promoted to T.
- VP-internal subject Hypothesis: DP (subject) is a specifier of a VP.
- DP movement from specifier of VP to specifier of TP
  - This is to handle SVO and SOV languages

## V to C movement

Subject-aux inversion for question formation.
Certain momvements are prohibited (due to the Verb Movement parameter)

## Do-support

When there is no other option for supporting inflectional affixes, insert the dummy verb do into T.

- original: You squeezed the toilet paper.
- transitional: (You **did** squeeze the toilet paper.)
- question: Did you squeeze the toilet paper?

Insertion of a dummy meaningless auxiliary "do" in the position of T.
Such that subj-aux inversion can operate on statement without auxiliary to form questions.

A type of operation of last resort.
