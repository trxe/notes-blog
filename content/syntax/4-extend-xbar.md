# X-bar 

1. Specifier rule: $XP \rightarrow (YP) X'$ (or reversed)
1. Adjunct rule: $X' \rightarrow (ZP) X'$ (or reversed)
1. Complement rule: $X' \rightarrow (WP) X$ (or reversed)

## Determiner Phrases

Note that **specifiers have to be phrasal (YP)**.
However determiners are not yet determined to be phrasal.

However they don't appear to be phrasal: 

> *the that goat

Proposition: **determiner phrase (DP)**.

![DP Hypothesis](/notes-blog/assets/img/syntax/dp-hyp.png)

Evidence:
1. Determiners are heads (in English, cannot have multiple)
2. Behaviour of possessives: 
   1. *Free* genitive or of-genitive (*the* X **of** *the* Y)
   2. *Construct* or 's-genitive (*the* headmaster **'s** office)
      1. does not allow both the possessor and possessed to have determiners

> - [the man standing over there]’s hat
> - *the man’s standing over there hat
> - *a building’s the roof 

Hence we have the following proposed DP structure for possessives.

## Complementizer Phrases

$$
CP \rightarrow \mathbf{C} \ TP
$$

Claim 1: **All clauses have CPs (complementizer phrases)**.

Claim 1.1: CPs at root/matrix clause have **null complementizers**.

Evidence: Analysis of yes/no questions.

> 1. John has eaten.
> 2. Has John eaten?
> 3. *Ar thit Sean?* (Q fall John // Did John fall?)

(1) and (2) demonstrate English's **subject-auxiliary inversion**. 
This is in *complementary distribution* with the occurrence of **question complementizers such as "Ar" in Irish** [see (3)].

![Subject Aux Inversion](/notes-blog/assets/img/syntax/subj-aux-inv.png)

This suggests that there is a null complementizer that the $T$ takes the place of
upon inversion.

![Null Complementizer](/notes-blog/assets/img/syntax/null-comp.png)

> 4. Fabio asked if Claus had won.
> 5. *Fabio asked (if had)/(had if) Claus won.

![Null Complementizer](/notes-blog/assets/img/syntax/null-comp.png)

This is further supported by how when the complementizer "if" is used, 
subj-aux inversion would not be applicable.

![If Complementizer](/notes-blog/assets/img/syntax/if-comp.png)

Same goes to show how you can conjoin a statement clause with a question clause.

### Can we have null complementizers

1. Apple:
   - [x] Phonology: apple
   - [x] Semantic: the fruit
   - [x] Syntactic: N [+COUNT]
1. ___ behave yourself!:
   - [ ] Phonology: $\emptyset$
   - [x] Semantic: 2nd person
   - [x] Syntactic: N [+PRONOUN, -ANAPHOR, -PLURAL]
1. eat-s: 
   - [x] Phonology: -s
   - [ ] Semantic
   - [x] Syntactic: suffix to verbs, -PLURAL, PRESENT, 3RD

## Tense Phrases

![Tense Phrase structure](/notes-blog/assets/img/syntax/tp-struct.png)

how to explain the difference between syntax of **infinite and finite clauses**?

how to explain conjunction of tensed verb phrase with auxiliary word phrase 
(cannot be former is VP and latter is NP)?

> [He was really mad] but [has he been calmer since]?

Hypothesis 1: 

### Affix-lowering (Hypothesis 1)

T **originally generates the tense affix**, and it is **lowered** to the position of V.

### Covert head selection

T is a null [+<TENSE>] selection.

### What about infinite (tenseless) clauses?

They do not show tense and agreement so do they form TP?

The **infinitizer** is the T.

Whtt about a string of verbs (multiple auxiliaries)? Only the first is the T.
See the ![interaction and satisfaction theory of agreement](https://www.eggschool.org/earlier-schools/egg-2017-olomouc-czech-republic/teachers-classes/advanced-courses/interaction-and-satisfaction-a-theory-of-agreement/).

[he had (null T) been wanting [to go there]]

- form of wanting is selected by been
- form of been is selected by had
- form of had is selcted by the null[+PAST]
