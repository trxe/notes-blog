# Lecture 1: What is Language

- cultural artifact
- code of communication
- thought articulation
- biological trait of humans

**Mapping** between *form* and *function*.

*Function*: communication, thoughts, meaning

*Form*: sounds and signs (gestures), less emphasis on writing which is a **recording**

The form to function continuum: **sound/sign**, **words**, **sentences**, **meanings**.

## How to **know** a language

What do we know about language to make us claim that we know a language?

- Knowledge of sound patterns (e.g. impossible consonant clusters, morphophonology.)
- Knowledge of word patterns (wugs /woegz/ nazzes /nazzez/)
- Knowledge of sentence patterns (ungrammatical sentences)
- Meaning patterns (some sentences commit to certain ideas as predicates)

## Language as a system

1. Generative
2. Rule-governed (Tacit and compositional)
3. Arbitrary (but standardized in order to make sense between communicating parties)

**Generative** system: Finite vocaulary $\Rightarrow$ new sentences

Outline of Proof: we can always take a part of a sentence and always add on something to it and still have it be valid.
  - A's b
  - A's b's c
  - A's b's c's d ...

We can understand such expressions of arbitrary complexity because interpretation is *compositional*.

**Rule-governed** system: present even in colloquial/stigmatized dialects of English 
(e.g. Singlish, African American English aka AAE)

- unconscious/tacit rules
- compositional as well

**Arbitrary** system: mapping of form to function is sometimes arbitrary (for individual morphemes to their meaning).

## Problem Set 1

*Question 1*:

|                       | Generative | Consciously taught | Arbitrary |
|-----------------------|------------|--------------------|-----------|
| human languages       | +          | mostly -           | +         |
| programming languages | +          | +                  | +         |
| dog commands          | -          | +                  | +         |
| morse code            | +          | +                  | +         |
| chinese characters    | -          | +                  | +         |
| bird song             | +          | -                  | +         |
| art                   | +          | -                  | +         |
| emoji                 | -          | -                  | +         |

*Question 2*:

It supports the idea that sign/sound and meaning mapping is arbitrary.
If it were not, then there would be more consistency between the onomatopoeia cross-culturally,
but in many cases they have no similarities at all, especially for the sounds of dog, pig.

Likely due to brain picking up different sounds.

# Lecture 2: Properties and Organization of Words

**Lexicon**: Mental table of mapping between forms and their meanings

**Lexical categories**: parts of speech
- nouns [N]
  - pronouns: no fixed reference
  - proper names
- verbs [V]
- adjectives [ADJ]
- adverbs [ADV]
- prepositions [P]

- Determiners [Det] e.g. a, the, this
- Conjunction [Conj] e.g. and, but, or
- Auxiliary Verb [Aux] e.g. modal verbs

**Content words**: 
- relatively easy to define, 
- open-class
- usually [N, V, ADJ, ADV]

**Function words**:
- grammatical functions
- closed-class
- usually [Det, Conj, P, Aux, pronouns]
- **Relationships** between the content words

Psychologically we treat content and function words differently (as can be seen from aphasics)

1. Content words more likely to switch
2. Content words less likely to omit (children learn them first)

## Morphemes

**Morphemes** are the smallest meaningful units in the language.

*Hypothesis*: Morphemes are stored in the lexicon
- implication: single mapping of morpheme form to function
- counterexample: -er has multiple meanings (e.g. teacher vs letter)

### Bound morphemes

Bound morphemes (cannot exist on their own) vs free morphemes (can)

Bound morphemes often have **rules** (see distribution) on what they can bind to.

The same morpheme can take on multiple meanings (e.g. the "un-" prefix)

This gives rise to **morphological structure trees**:

## Problem Set 2

1. dis-obey
2. happ-ily
3. logic-ally
4. em-power-ment
5. pre-mature
6. mis-understand-ing
7. re-form-ation
8. un-surpris-ing-ly

Zulu nouns and verbs:

a) singular "um", plural "aba"
b) "a"
c) "i" is a suffix for noun class
d) "baz", "fund"
