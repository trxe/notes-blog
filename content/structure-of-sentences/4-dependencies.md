# Dependencies -- Heads and their Dependents

## Pre-reading quiz

1. Verbs may require their dependent NPs to occur in a particular gender. 
    - ~True~ FALSE! Gender is a property of the NP

2. We cannot tell from the word class of a phrase whether it is a complement or an adjunct. 
    - true
    - "I wrote the report (carefully)"
    - "You should tread *(carefully)"
    - carefully is an adverb in both the first and second sentence but it is only necessary in the first sentence

3. There is a strong tendency, crosslinguistically, for the head to occur in a fixed position in relation to its complements, and for this order to be the same across all phrases within a language. 
  - True (head initial, head final)

4. Which of the following is the best example of a zero-marking language? 
  - Chinese
  - Vietnamese
  - Very little inflectional morphology

5. English is typically thought of as a head-marking language. 
   - False. Dependent marking language.

## Heads of phrases

- NP: very bright **sunflowers**
- VP: **overflowed** quite quickly
- AP: very **bright**
- AdvP: quite **quickly**
- PP: **inside** the house

Tests:

1. Heads are obligatory and removing them changes the entire meaning of the sentence
2. Replace the phrase with just the head. 
   - The head is the only word that has the same distribution as the entire phrase.
3. Heads impose restrictions on it's dependents 
   1. "See"-r must be animate and have vision

- **Head** bears semantic info
- Word class of the head = word class of the phrase
- Heads select **dependent** phrases of particular word class (complements)
  - Agree with some or all of the grammatical features of Head

## Complement and Adjunct Dependents

Complement: Required. Typically closer to head.

Adjunct: Optional

Each subordinate clauses [component]

- Distinguish Concept  from the actualconcrete phrase
"The teacher told ary [to see them after]
generally phrase only can have 1 dependent
- Mary 

## Verb classes

- Intransitive (Subject)    
  - May have an adjunct in the VP (e.g. a PP adjunct)
- Transitive (Subject + Direct Object)
  - Take an **NP complement**
  - **Test**: Passive construction form. Inversion of the subject and object: 
    - if the predicated object can become the subject in the form "is X'd [PP]",
    - it is the direct object.
- Ditransitive
  - 2 complements within the VP: NP + NP/PP
  - sometimes it's a direct object NP and a clausal complement to that NP.
    - sometimes that NP can be finite or infinite
    - X persuaded Y that they should leave early [finite]
    - X persuaded Y to leave early [infinite]
  - **Prepositional verbs** take PP complement

Verbs can appear in more than 1 subclass!
1. with finite clause "remembered that he picked up"
2. with infinitival clause "remembered to pick up"
3. with gerund-participial clause "remembered picking up"

## Preposition classes

- Always transitive (beside)
- 

## Complementizer

e.g. "that", "for", "whether"


# Head initial vs Head final

## Head-marking vs Dependent-marking

Head and dependent relations: [Head: Dependent]

cross linguistically common

1. Adposition (AP) aka PP (Post/Pre) : objectNP
2. V : arguemtns of verb
3. possessed N : possessor NP
   1. Sandy **'s** ring
4. N : adjective

| Consturction               | Head      | Deps                        |
|----------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| clause                     | pred      | sub, comp, adjuncts of pred |
| adpos phrase               | adpos     | complement of Adpos         |
| possessive                 | possessed | possessor                   |
| noun + modifying adjective | noun      | adjective                   |

English specifics:
1. English has head-initial clause.
2. English has head-final noun following modifying adj
3.  English has 2 types of posessive:
  - cat's tail: head-final
  - tail of the cat: head-initial
4. English has head-initial adpositional phrase 

Head marking langs have **extensive agreement** aka cross-referencing.
- e.g. Markers on the verb (of VP) indicating both the subject and object

Dependent marking langs have **case systems**:
- dependents show grammatical relation.
o nominative/accusative/dative etc.

**zero-marking** languages e.g. Chinese.
1. Neutral marking
2. Languages with no to little morphology
3. e.g. Chinese, Vietnamese
   1. Pronouns always same form
