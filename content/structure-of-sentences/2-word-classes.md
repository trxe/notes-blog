# Word Classes, Semantic Roles and Grammatical Relations

## Pre-reading quiz

1. Words can belong to more than one class. 
   -  Yes (e.g. wish is either a NOUN or a VERB)
2. Which of the following word classes is/are uncontroversially found in all languages?
   -  Verbs
   -  Nouns
3. How many morphological tenses does English have?
   - 2
4. The semantic role of a noun phrase argument is determined by the ...
   - Verb
5. What word class are the grammatical categories case and gender most typically associated with? 
   - Noun

## Word Classes/Parts of speech/Lexical Category

**Share certain features** (environments/morphological operations)

Clearly there are different word classes. When we perform **gap tests** we cannot insert in just any word.

- A *cheetah/hammer/plank* can be dangerous
- A *\*sing/joyous/sadly* can be dangerous

**Distributionalism**: 
- General theory of language 
- discovery procedure for establishing elements and language structure based on observed use.

We discover word classes by **distributional evidence**:
1. Gap Test
2. Modification test 
   1. e.g. is the word **engine** in *engine driver* a noun or adjective? Ans: NOUN
   2. **electric** (adj) engine (N) driver 
   3. \***electrically** (adv) engine (N) driver
   2. \***unbelievable** (adj) good (ADJ) driver 
   3. **unbelievably** (adv) good (ADV) driver

The below are the **sufficient** (but **not necessary**) criteria to qualify in a word class!
- e.g. Not all nouns take the plural -s

   1. What different **forms** can the word take on in different syntactic contexts (**morphosyntax**/form)
   2. **Where** in a phrase does the word occur, what can modify it (**distribution**)
      1. Change the verb (like --> hate)
      2. Change the environment (Did you [[V] predicate] --> She wanted to [[V] predicate])
   3. What **function** does the word take on in a phrase/sentence?

Linguists **do not use semantic criteria** to determine word class, as they can be misdiagnosed 
(i.e. N = name of person/place/thing etc.)

**Classes examples**

- Open Classes: N/V/ADV/ADJ [Lexical content words]
- Closed Classes: P/Det/Pronoun/Conj [Functional grammatical words]

## Verbs

Expresses **predication**.

### Noun phrases surrounding verbs

- *Predicate*: expresses an event (or action, process, situation or state etc.)
- *Argument*: **obligatory** participant in the event (can be a singular or plural)
- *Complement*: non-subject phrase that is syntactically required.
- *Adjunct*: optional phrases

Complements and Arguments are **not mutually exclusive**.

#### Omission test for argument/complement/adjunct

If a phrase  is omissible, it is likely optional.

### Verb classes

- *Intransitive*: Singular argument only (X verb)
- *Transitive*: Dual arguments necessary (X verb Y)
- *Ditransitive*: (X verb Y to/for Z)

*Ambitransitivity*:
- A lot of times active/passive voice affects the arguments of the verb. 
- e.g. Active takes 2 args, Passive takes 1 arg.
- Passive being characterized by **auxiliary** (e.g. be/get)

### Tense, Aspect, Mood

*Tense*: a representation in grammar of *location in time*.

*Aspect*: is the action ongoing/completed.

- Progressive (e.g. -ing)
- Perfect (completed action, e.g. has (still true)/had (no longer true))
- Habitual

*Mood*: possibility, probability, certainty

- Indicative (actual events)
- Modal auxiiliaries (would, could, should etc.)
  - Subjunctive (hypotheticals)

*Agreement* (as in subject-verb agreement): properties of the noun phrase that match the verb used.

## Nouns

Usually the arguments of verbs.

Noun phrase (aka nominal phrase, short **NP**): a phrase with 
- **noun or pronoun** as its **head**
- performs same grammatical role as **noun**

### Semantic roles of NPs

Roles don't have a universally agreed upon definition.

- Agent: Deliberate performer of action
- Experiencer: Subject of mental/emo process/state
- Stimulus
- Patient/Theme: Thing that action is affecting
- Recipient/Beneficiary
- Location
  - Goal
  - Source
  - Path
- Instrument: Tool

The same subject can have multiple semantic roles.

### Syntactic Roles of NPs

- *Subject*: normal position **immediately before the verb** (regardless active or passive voice!)
- (Direct) *Object*: after the verb
- Predicative Complement (NOT OBJECT): A is **B** (B is in the predicate and a state but not an active participant.)
- Prepositional (Indirect) Object: A does B on **C**.

#### SVA

Subjects control **Subject/Verb Agreement**.

#### Case Marking

Subjects also exhibit **Case marking**:
some NPs or pronouns have special forms depending on its grammatical relation.

- I/me, She/her, He/him, They/them
- "Subject" forms (first ver.) = **nominative** case forms

#### Subject-Auxiliary inversion, Tagging

- He has/Has he?
- He does, doesn't he?

### Noun characteristics

- Person: First/Second/Third (relation of speaker/addressee/outsiders)
- Number: Singular/Plural
- Gender: Noun classification (not just M/F!)
- Possession: Can this noun be possessed by a person? If it can be, is it alienable/inalienable to the person?
- **Case**: Nominative (of subject)/Accusative (of object)
  - Grammatical relation
  - Sometimes conveyed by position in sentence, sometimes marked morphologically on the NP itself.

## Adjectives

Word class Tests (indicative but not necessary):
1. Intensity Modifier aka Intensifiers ("really/very/mildly")
   1. Fails when the adjective itself isn't **gradable** (e.g. an item cannot be more *residual* than another)
2. Comparison category (comparative/superlative/equative)
   1. Fails when adjective is not comparable
3. Agreement (in other languages, adjectives must agree with the noun its modifying)
   1. le vin blanc/la porte blanche (blanc is M, blanche is F; French)
4. "seems - " test

Functions:

- *Attributive*: "The very *pretty* lady"
  - Modifying a noun only
- *Predicative*: is in the predicate, is in complement. "The lady is very *pretty*"
  - Preceding verb ("She *is* pretty")

If ADJ is not an open class in the language, then N/NP/V takes over the functions of ADJ in other languages.
- e.g. Ari is kind (ADJ) / Ari has kindness (N)

## Adverbs

Traditionally ragbag category, undefined

Some are related to adjectives - Shared properties:
- Intensifier tests
- Comparison category tests
- As ____ as

Superclass of adj and adv: A

- Adjectives modify nouns
- Adverbs modify non-nouns

(Not adjunct! Any word class can be an adjunct)

## Determiners

Position in English: always right before N/NP "[Det] [N/NP]"

- Articles: indicate definitiveness
  - **Definiteness**: a semantic feature of NPs, distinguishing between **identifiable** NPs and inidentifiable ones.
- Demonstratives (these/this/those)
- Wh-determiners (5W1H)
- Quantifiers (some, each, many)
- Possessive determiners (my, his, our)

Not pronouns!

Cross-linguisticaly, determiners are common but not obligatory. 
Many languages have a much more restricted set of determiners.

## Preposition

Tests:
- Right/straight/just modifier test
  - "Just" is problematic!
  - There are some prepositions that can never be modified by these!
- **Transitive** or **Intransitive**
  - Transitive: of
  - Intransitive: 
  - But don't bear tense, aspect, mood etc.
  - Adverbs never modify nouns but PPs often do
  - Adverbs never complement the copula "be"-words but PPs often can
