# Sentences and clauses

## Pre-reading quiz

1. All predicates are verbs.  
   - False (most predicates' heads are verb, but predicates are not verbs themselves)
   - Predicates most often verbal, but actually can be adjectival/nominal predicates too

2. Main verbs are also known as ... 
   - Lexical verb

3. In English, the -ing form of verbs is known as ... 
   - Present participle
   - Gives progressive aspect

4. English only allows one finite verb in every sentence. 
   - No
   - One finite verb in every **independent** clause/sentence but not for **complex, multi-clause** sentences

5. Crosslinguistically, root clauses can be identified by the fact that they do not have complementizers. 
   - No
   - NOT UNIVERSAL

## Finiteness and Auxiliaries

From the previous chapter:

- *Predicate*: expresses an event (or action, process, situation or state etc.)

New definitions:

- *Clause*: Sentence containing a predicate.
  - *Independent* sentences/clauses: Clauses that don't require to be attached to others.
- *Finiteness*: A verb that is allowed to be the only verb in an independent clause.
  - Often includes **tense information** but not necessarily depending on the language
  - In a sequence of verbs/aux (e.g. "may have been working") the **first** is the finite verb/aux.
  - **Test for finiteness**: if you can replace it with another tense. If you can't, it is most probably not the finite verb/aux

Semantically different types of verbs:

- Main Verb: verbs with semantic/lexical meaning
- Auxiliaries: verbs adding grammatical meaning to the main verb
  - usually accompanying an "**inifite** verb"/participle

### Modal Auxiliaries

- Only finite form
- always the first (rendering the rest non-finite) in a sequence of verbs
- No -s (3rd SG) inflection

### Have/Be: Either a Main Verb or Auxiliary

It is obvious what have and be are as the main verb.

As auxiliaries, they express **aspect**:

- be-ing gives **progressive** (in progress) aspect
- hav-ing gives **perfect** (completion extent) aspect

### Non-finite verbs: Infinitives and Participles 

**Infinitives**: identified by their distribution.  Examples include

- After modal aux
- After infinitival "to" in a verb sequence (not the PP/NP "to")

**Participles**: generally non-finte verbs that primarily co-occurs with finite aux.

- -ing participle: the present participle
- -ed participle: the past participle

### Summary

1. A normal sentence has one finite main verb XOR auxiliary.
2. Finite element always occurs first in the sequence of aux/verbs
3. The rest are non-finite.
4. The main verb is the last in the sequence of aux/verbs
5. Aux have + past participle = **perfect** aspect
6. Aux be + past participle = **progressive** aspect

Grammatical categories on verb can be exhibited by:
1. Inflections on the main verb
2. Auxiliary
3. Separate word/particle

## Subordination

### Subordinate clauses

**Matrix** clause: sentence embedding another clause

**Subordinate** clause: the clause embedded in the matrix clause. 

**Root** clause: the highest matrix clause.

It is an **obligatory argument** of the verb in the matrix clause.

**Properties** of subordinate clauses:

1. Introduced by a **complementizer** e.g. whether, if, that
   1. The matrix verb selects this complementizer, not interchangeable.
2. Finiteness: root clauses must be finite.
3. Some subordinate clauses have **no overt subject**, with the subject being understood from the matrix clause.

### Complement clauses

**Complement** clauses: Subordinate clauses **selected by a verb**  in the matrix clause (in predicate position)

Also can take the form of **clausal subjects**: in the subject position. Can be tested by replacing with an NP.

### Adjunct/Adverbial clauses

Not a necessary component of their parent clause (optional 
subordinate clause).

Not selected by any verb.

### Subordinate clause identification

Find the main verb. 1 Main verb = 1 Independent clause.

**Root** clause possible properties:

1. Finiteness
2. (Cross-linguistically) potentially has different word order from embedded clauses.
3. Some languages (including English) root clauses don't have complementizers.

**Root** clause properties in **English**:
- only root clause can have aux inversion ("She didn't..." to "Didn't she...")
- can have tag questions ("She x'ed, **didn't she**?")
